# AI_LIE_DETECTOR
This project detects lies by analyzing multiple human signals using AI and IoT. It captures facial expressions and pupil dilation through a camera, voice pitch via a microphone, and heart rate using an Arduino pulse sensor. These inputs are processed with machine learning to determine if a person is lying.
